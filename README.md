In order for this app to work, you need to register for an account on weatherstack.com. It is free. Once you have an account, you will receive an api access key. This api access key is used to call the weather api. You have the option to manually enter the api key from your keyboard and then you have the option to save this key to a text file on your computer called apikey.txt and then later on you can just load the api key from this text file. Once the api key has been entered, you need to enter the city. After the api key and city has been entered, you will then choose option #4 to call the weather api and then choose option #5 to display the weather data.

This weather app displays the country, region, city, and temperature in celsius and fahrenheit.
